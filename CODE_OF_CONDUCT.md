# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment in our project. As contributors and maintainers, we pledge to ensure that everyone, regardless of experience, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality, feels welcome and respected.

## Our Standards
To create a positive experience for all, we commit to:

- **Being respectful** of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- **Providing constructive feedback** and focusing on what's best for the community.
- **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes. We will learn from the experience.
- **Showing empathy** towards others and supporting each other.

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Using inappropriate language or making offensive comments.
- Harassment in any form, including unwelcome sexual attention, personal attacks, or trolling.
- Demeaning or discriminatory behavior towards anyone, whether publicly or privately.
- Publishing private information about others without explicit permission.

## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair action when those standards are violated. Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, or other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the project, including GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions. It also applies to other community spaces like forums, chat rooms, or public meetings where contributors represent the project.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [Your Contact Email]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and the project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.
