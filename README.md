3.Store resumes and job descriptions in a MySQL database.
4.Compare resumes against job descriptions using TF-IDF and cosine similarity algorithms.
5.Rank resumes based on relevance to the job description.
6.Simple frontend interface to view ranked resumes.

Tech Stack:
Backend: Java (Spring Boot), MySQL
Machine Learning: Python (Flask, scikit-learn)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Containerization: Docker

This project automates the initial screening process for recruiters, saving time and effort by filtering and ranking resumes efficiently.
